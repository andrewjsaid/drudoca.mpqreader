## MPQ File Format Specifications

There doesn't seem to be any official (Blizzard) specification for how the file format works,
however there are many unofficial community descriptions

I have read the following:

## Goals
1. Implement reading MPQ archives. I only want to implement enough to parse Starcraft II replays, at least for now.
2. Keep performance a top priority.
